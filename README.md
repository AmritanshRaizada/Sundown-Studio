# üåá Sundown Studio Landing Page 

A fully responsive and animated landing page inspired by **Sundown Studio**. This project was one of the first milestones in my **Frontend Development journey**, helping me explore layout design, animations, responsiveness, and interaction patterns.

## üöÄ About The Project

This is a **clone of Sundown Studio‚Äôs official website landing page**, built as a personal frontend challenge. It replicates the bold typography, smooth transitions, and creative layout that define Sundown's visual identity.

> üî® Built during my early learning phase to practice real-world UI/UX design with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques.
